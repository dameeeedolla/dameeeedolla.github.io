<p> I come from a small down called Del Rio, Texas. It is a border town and even though I don't know spanish, I like to call my ethnicity hispanic. </p> 
<p> I also love to play basketball and run with my friends. I like to stay fit and be able to get my brain up and running besides doing school work. </p>
